<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One pot chicken and mushroom orzo</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
    <li>2 large shallots, diced</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 cup orzo pasta</li>
    <li>3-4 cups baby spinach</li>
    <li>1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Season chicken with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
    <li>Add mushrooms and shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir in chicken stock and Dijon, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in orzo; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked through, about 6 minutes. Stir in spinach, Parmesan and heavy cream until the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.</li>
